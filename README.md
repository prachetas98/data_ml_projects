The FGVC (Fine-Grained Visual Categorization) airplane project aimed to tackle the challenging task of classifying images of airplanes into distinct categories. Leveraging deep learning techniques, we explored various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and other models to achieve accurate and robust classification. The dataset, consisting of thousands of airplane images, posed a fine-grained categorization challenge, demanding models capable of identifying differences between aircraft types.

We started by experimenting with CNN models, progressing to more advanced architectures such as ResNet and InceptionV3. The continous process of fine-tuning these models grasped the capability to extract unique features to determine the difference between airplane classes. We encountered challenges related to model complexity and data augmentation

Some models demonstrated substantial accuracy improvements, others highlighted the importance of model complexity in handling fine-grained distinctions. The incorporation of transfer learning, ensemble methods, and adjustments in hyperparameters were pivotal in refining our models.

Despite facing challenges, the project served as a valuable exploration of deep learning methodologies in the context of fine-grained visual categorization. The significance of model interpretability, parameter tuning, and architectural choices became apparent. The project's scope encompassed not only achieving high accuracy but also understanding the limitations, providing a comprehensive view of the complexities inherent in the fine-grained categorization of airplane images.
